# Robot Hand Geometry Parameters:
# finger_width: the width of the finger
# outer_diameter: the diameter of the robot hand (= maximum aperture plus 2 * finger width)
# hand_depth: the finger length (measured from hand base to finger tip)
# hand_height: the height of the hand
# init_bite: the minimum distance between the fingertip and the side of the object that is oriented toward the hand
# max_grasp_num: maximum number of output grasps, if the value set to 0, then output all grasp candidates
